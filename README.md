YouTrack Worklog Viewer
=======================
YouTrack Worklog Viewer helps you keep track of your booked time in the commercial [Jetbrains YouTrack](https://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack/) Issue tracker 
by connecting to your YouTrack  instance and downloads the booked work time within a definable timespan.

## Troubleshooting

**How do I start the application?**

*Simply open up your terminal/console and start the application with `[/path/to/java-11/bin/]java -jar youtrack-worklog-viewer-[version].jar` or right click the file and select `Open with...` and then select the path to your java executable*

**How do I setup the authentication in YouTrack?**

*There is a tutorial on how to configure YouTrack authentication on the [Wiki page](https://github.com/pbauerochse/youtrack-worklog-viewer/wiki/Authentication-with-YouTrack).*

**Which YouTrack versions are supported?**

*Support for YouTrack versions older than 2017.4 has been dropped in the Worklog Viewer version 2.4.0. If you have a YouTrack version between 6 and 2017.4, please use any YouTrack WorklogViewer release before 2.4.0*

**I just get a blank report. What's wrong?**

*There are several reasons, why this might happen:*

* **You entered a wrong username in the settings** - *This tool checks your personal worklog by comparing your username from the settings screen, with the worklog author name from the report. YouTrack seems to allow you to have a different username than the login name. Please make sure, that in your YouTrack profile, the login name is the same as your actual username*
* **You selected the wrong connector version** - *Jetbrains is constantly working on their product. To adapt to the changes, you need to specify the matching connector version in the settings dialog. Please check, if you have selected an outdated version in the settings*
* **There simply are no tracked work items in the specified time range**

**I found a bug / have a question / have a feature request**

*Please feel free to file an issue here at the Github project and I'll see what I can do.*
